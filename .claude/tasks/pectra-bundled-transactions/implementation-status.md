# Pectra Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

1. **FutarchyBatchExecutorMinimal Contract**
   - Deployed at: `0x65eb5a03635c627a0f254707712812B234753F31`
   - Confirmed: NO 0xEF opcodes
   - Functions correctly with "Only self" check
   - Supports up to 10 calls via `execute10()`

2. **Code Updates**
   - `EIP7702TransactionBuilder`: Updated to use `execute10()` interface
   - `bundle_helpers.py`: Added state-based simulation functions
   - `buy_cond_eip7702_minimal.py`: Complete rewrite for minimal executor

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Test scripts created and verified contract functionality
   - On-chain test confirmed contract behavior

## 🚧 Current Blocker

**EIP-7702 Support in eth-account**

- Current version (0.11.3) doesn't have `sign_authorization` method
- Need eth-account version that supports EIP-7702 (likely v0.13+)
- This is blocking actual EIP-7702 transaction execution

## 📋 Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for EIP-7702 Support

- Monitor eth-account releases for EIP-7702 support
- Once available, update dependencies and test

### Option 2: Alternative Testing Approach

1. Deploy a test wrapper contract that can call the executor
2. Remove the "Only self" check for testing (deploy test version)
3. Use a different library that supports EIP-7702

### Option 3: Manual EIP-7702 Implementation

- Implement the authorization signing manually
- Use raw transaction construction
- More complex but allows immediate testing

## 🔧 What Works Now

1. **Contract Infrastructure**: ✅
   - FutarchyBatchExecutorMinimal deployed and verified
   - No 0xEF opcodes blocking execution
   - Proper function selectors in bytecode

2. **Bundle Construction**: ✅
   - Correctly builds execute10() calls
   - Handles approval optimization
   - Fits within 10-call limit

3. **Simulation Logic**: ✅
   - State-based tracking implemented
   - Balance change detection
   - Works with eth_call and state overrides

## 📊 Testing Results

```
Contract Verification: ✅ PASSED
- Size: 1379 bytes
- 0xEF opcodes: 0
- execute10() selector: Found
- executeOne() selector: Found

On-Chain Test: ✅ Behavior Correct
- Transaction failed with "Only self"
- This is expected without EIP-7702
- Contract logic is working properly
```

## 🎯 Production Readiness

Once EIP-7702 support is available:

1. **Immediate Tasks**:
   - Update eth-account to EIP-7702-compatible version
   - Test authorization signing
   - Verify bundled execution works

2. **Testing Plan**:
   - Start with 0.001 sDAI test transactions
   - Gradually increase to 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 sDAI
   - Monitor gas usage and profitability

3. **Integration**:
   - Update pectra_bot.py to use minimal executor
   - Add fallback to sequential execution
   - Implement monitoring and alerts

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **For Testing Now**: Deploy a test version of FutarchyBatchExecutorMinimal without the self-check restriction
2. **For Production**: Wait for proper EIP-7702 support in eth-account or implement manual signing
3. **Risk Management**: Keep sequential execution as fallback until bundled execution is proven stable
