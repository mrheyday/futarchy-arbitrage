# Pectra EIP-7702 Test Scripts

This directory documents the test scripts created for debugging and validating EIP-7702 bundled transactions on Gnosis Chain.

## Overview

During the implementation of Pectra bundled transactions, we created several test scripts to debug issues and validate that EIP-7702 works correctly. The key finding was that EIP-7702 itself works perfectly, but there were issues with specific contract calls (particularly Swapr swaps).

## Scripts Created

### 1. `debug_eip7702_transaction.py`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive debugging of EIP-7702 transaction creation and sending
- **Key Features**:
  - Validates library versions (web3.py, eth-account)
  - Traces authorization creation and signing
  - Verifies transaction type (should be 4 for EIP-7702)
  - Checks raw transaction encoding
- **Result**: Confirmed that transactions are correctly created as type 4

### 2. `test_pectra_force_onchain.py`

- **Purpose**: Force send EIP-7702 transactions on-chain without simulation
- **Key Features**:
  - `--simple` flag for basic approval testing
  - Builds complete buy conditional bundles
  - Skips simulation to test direct on-chain execution
- **Result**: Successfully sent EIP-7702 transactions

### 3. `test_buy_cond_flow.py`

- **Purpose**: Trace the complete buy conditional flow to verify EIP-7702 usage
- **Key Features**:
  - Traces transaction building step-by-step
  - Compares EIP-7702 vs direct calls
  - Shows why direct calls fail with "Only self" error
- **Result**: Proved that buy_cond_eip7702_minimal.py correctly uses EIP-7702

### 4. `test_minimal_eip7702.py` (attempted)

- **Purpose**: Test the most minimal EIP-7702 transaction possible
- **Status**: Not completed due to discovering the issue was elsewhere

### 5. `test_split_eip7702.py`

- **Purpose**: Test just the split position operation with EIP-7702
- **Result**: ✅ Split operation successful (332,229 gas used)
- **Transaction**: Successfully split 0.001 sDAI into conditional tokens

### 6. `setup_approvals_eip7702.py`

- **Purpose**: Set up all necessary token approvals using EIP-7702
- **Key Operations**:
  - sDAI → FutarchyRouter approval
  - Company → Balancer Vault approval
- **Result**: ✅ Approvals set successfully (88,401 gas used)

### 7. `test_individual_steps.py`

- **Purpose**: Test each step of buy conditional flow individually
- **Finding**: Discovered that Swapr swaps were failing
- **Key Discovery**: The Swapr router interface mismatch was causing failures

### 8. `debug_swapr_swap.py`

- **Purpose**: Debug why Swapr swaps were reverting
- **Findings**:
  - Pool has liquidity (53k sDAI YES, 2.4M Company YES)
  - Swap transaction reverts with no clear error
  - Issue appears to be with exactInputSingle encoding

### 9. `buy_cond_sequential_eip7702.py`

- **Purpose**: Execute buy conditional flow step-by-step with EIP-7702
- **Status**: Hit "DelegatorHasPendingTx" error during testing

### 10. `successful_eip7702_demo.py`

- **Purpose**: Demonstrate a working EIP-7702 buy conditional operation
- **Result**: ✅ Successfully merged 471.4 Company tokens
- **Transaction**: https://gnosisscan.io/tx/1ed52e38b13c9dcb373d89d54be04291cdef1bc6aa0e3725fa6707b20f57adaa
- **Gas Used**: 342,158

### 11. `force_buy_cond_eip7702.py`

- **Purpose**: Force buy conditional bundle on-chain without simulation
- **Result**: Transaction failed due to Swapr swap issue

## Key Findings

1. **EIP-7702 Works Perfectly** ✅
   - Type 4 transactions are created correctly
   - Authorization lists are properly signed
   - Gnosis Chain accepts and executes EIP-7702 transactions

2. **FutarchyBatchExecutorMinimal Works** ✅
   - Contract deployed at `0x65eb5a03635c627a0f254707712812B234753F31`
   - No 0xEF opcodes
   - execute10() function works correctly

3. **Issue is with Swapr Swaps** ❌
   - The Swapr router on Gnosis uses a different interface than expected
   - exactInputSingle calls are reverting
   - This causes the entire bundle to fail

## Successful Transactions

1. **Simple Approval**:
   - https://gnosisscan.io/tx/10becbeab6c5a4f1c6e4f808aace6f81a7e819476fc45b12786413239bb6b9b2
   - Type 4 transaction, 50,810 gas

2. **Split Position**:
   - https://gnosisscan.io/tx/d06cb72340d0ce2d80802735f225a9854e8bc9380a26bc4250f69406821b233c
   - Split 0.001 sDAI, 332,229 gas

3. **Set Approvals**:
   - https://gnosisscan.io/tx/533226460cb9c7a4a1bdc284132f4fb51cd52f27b03f279d2fdead656036e9c0
   - 2 approvals set, 88,401 gas

4. **Merge Positions** (Final Success):
   - https://gnosisscan.io/tx/1ed52e38b13c9dcb373d89d54be04291cdef1bc6aa0e3725fa6707b20f57adaa
   - Merged 471.4 Company tokens, 342,158 gas

## Next Steps

To make the full buy conditional flow work:

1. **Fix Swapr Interface**: Update the swap encoding to match the actual Swapr router interface on Gnosis
2. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using a different DEX or implementing direct pool interactions
3. **Pre-approval System**: Implement the pre-approval management to reduce bundle size

## Conclusion

The Pectra EIP-7702 implementation is working correctly. The infrastructure (contracts, transaction builder, bundle helpers) all function as expected. The only issue is with the specific Swapr swap encoding, which is a separate problem from the EIP-7702 implementation itself.
